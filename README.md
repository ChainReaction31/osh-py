# OSH-PY
This is a pure Python implementation of SWE Common and SensorML meant to be directly compatible with OpenSensorHub

##WIP Features
1. Full Implementation of OGC SWE Common Data Model (Ver. 2.0)
2. Full Implementation of OGC SensorML
3. Communication with OpenSensorHub as standard (able to operate as an OSH node)
    * SOS (SOS-T)
    * SPS
    * Other Serial Communication Protocols
4. Easy Simulation of common sensor type
5. Rapid Deployment Capability
6. Proper Admin Web Interface (Potentially a separate project)
7. Definition Repository and possible Reverse Driver Creation(RDC) using mark-up or other simple description
